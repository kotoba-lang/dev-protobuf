  "The suite under ClojureScript.

  Not a convenience. This library's callers -- `tech-ipfs-specs-ipns`,
  `io-libp2p-specs-kad-dht` -- run in Cloudflare Workers and browsers, so
  ClojureScript is the runtime it is actually deployed to, and until
  2026-08-17 the suite had only ever been run on the JVM. Three defects were
  sitting in the green:

    - varints past 2^53 decoded to silently wrong numbers (2^63-1 came back as
      9223372036854776000), while the JVM decoded them exactly
    - `fixed64` encode emitted the low four octets twice, because
      `bit-shift-right` is int32 there and its shift count wraps at 32
    - two assertions were host-dependent in the test itself, so they compared
      different things on the two runtimes and passed on both

  A gate that runs one runtime for a library that ships to the other is the
  shape ADR-2608136000 calls a check that cannot answer the question.
